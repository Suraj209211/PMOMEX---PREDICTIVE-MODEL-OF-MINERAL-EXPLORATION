# Predictive Model of Mineral Exploration

This repository contains the code and resources for a predictive model designed to enhance mineral exploration efforts. The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze geological, geochemical, and geophysical data, identifying areas with a high probability of mineral deposits.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Tools for cleaning and preprocessing raw exploration data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques to extract meaningful features from complex datasets.
- **Model Training:** Implementation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks) to build predictive models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics and visualization tools to assess the performance of the models.
- **Prediction and Mapping:** Methods to apply the trained models to new data and visualize potential mineral hotspots on a map.

## Installation

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https:
cd mineral-exploration-predictive-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Place your raw data files in the `data/` directory.
   - Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Use the provided notebooks to extract features from your data.
   - Save the processed features for model training.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Choose a machine learning algorithm and configure the parameters.
   - Train the model using the prepared dataset.
   - Evaluate the model performance using the evaluation scripts.

4. **Prediction and Mapping:**
